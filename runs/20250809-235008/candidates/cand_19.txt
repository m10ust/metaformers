We need to respond exactly in the given format. Provide a novel architecture or mechanism to improve metacognition in transformer-based LLMs. Use the exact format:

We must ensure exactly that formatting, with headings and bullets. We can propose a novel architecture: maybe "Dynamic Confidence-Modulated Attention (DCMA)" or "Self-Evaluating Prediction Head (SEPH)". Provide 4 steps: add meta head, compute confidence via a learned gating function, use to weight outputs, if low confidence, trigger "Self-Refine" submodule, training with combined loss. Provide reasons: reduces hallucinations, calibrates uncertainty, energy efficiency.

Make sure to not include any extra content. Ensure headings correct. Use "##" as headings. Use bullet list with hyphens. All good.
...done thinking.

## Conceptual Insight  
We propose a **Self‑Evaluating Prediction Head (SEPH)** that sits parallel to every transformer block and learns to assign a confidence score to the block’s output. SEPH uses a lightweight neural function that maps logits to a binary confidence via a sign‐like sigmoid, then exponentiates this confidence to produce a sharp, interpretable weight. The weights are applied to the original block outputs, allowing the model to down‑weight unreliable predictions and up‑weight trustworthy ones. If the aggregated confidence falls below a threshold, a lightweight “RefineNet” re‑processes the input with a higher‑capacity attention configuration.

## Practical Mechanism  
1. **Add SEPH Heads** – For each transformer layer, instantiate a SEPH head that receives the layer’s pre‑softmax logits and outputs a confidence probability through a two‑stage transformation (binary mapping → exponential scaling).  
2. **Weighted Fusion** – Multiply the layer’s output distribution by its SEPH confidence weight and fuse weighted outputs across layers to form the final logits.  
3. **Adaptive Re‑computation** – If the summed confidence of the top‑k predictions is below a learnable threshold, trigger the RefineNet module to re‑compute the logits using a higher‑capacity transformer block (or alternative sampling strategy).  
4. **Joint Training** – Optimize the entire stack end‑to‑end with a composite loss: cross‑entropy for task accuracy, a confidence calibration loss (e.g., Kullback‑Leibler between predicted confidence and empirical accuracy), and a sparsity penalty on high‑confidence gates to encourage efficient computation.

## Why This Matters  
- Reduces hallucinations by letting the model self‑regulate unreliable predictions and only invoke expensive re‑computation when necessary.  
- Provides calibrated uncertainty signals that can be consumed by downstream systems for decision‑making and risk assessment.  
- Improves compute efficiency, as the adaptive gate allows most tokens to bypass costly refinement, making deployment feasible on edge or safety‑critical devices.
