We need to respond in exact format. The user is asking to propose novel architecture or mechanism to improve metacognition in transformer-based LLMs. Provide conceptual insight (2-4 sentences), practical mechanism steps 1-4, and "Why This Matters" bullet list.

We must adhere exactly to that format, no extra text before/after. So start with "## Conceptual Insight" etc. Ensure each step enumerated. Provide 4 steps. In Why This Matters bullet points.

The content: propose something like a "Meta-Module" that runs a parallel transformer on internal hidden states to generate a confidence vector and reflection, then injects bias. But refine. Provide clarity on step 1 being concise. Also address step 4: injecting corrective bias into logits versus adjusting attention. We'll explain injection of bias as scaling logits by reflection vector. Or using gating. And mention safety applications: medical, finance, autonomous, etc.

Let's write accordingly.
...done thinking.

## Conceptual Insight  
A lightweight “Meta‑Module” runs in parallel to the main transformer, taking the latest hidden states as input and producing a *reflection vector* that scores the plausibility of each token. This vector is then used to modulate the next‑step attention and to inject a calibrated bias into the logits, giving the model an explicit, learnable sense of its own uncertainty that can be leveraged for safety‑critical decisions.

## Practical Mechanism  
1. **Embedding Snapshot** – At every decoding step, the main transformer’s hidden state (mathbf{h}_t) is forwarded to the Meta‑Module as a condensed embedding.  
2. **Reflection Generation** – The Meta‑Module, a shallow transformer block, processes (mathbf{h}_t) and outputs a reflection vector (mathbf{r}_t in mathbb{R}^V) (where (V) is the vocabulary size) indicating the model’s confidence for each candidate token.  
3. **Attention Adjustment** – (mathbf{r}_t) is projected to a set of attention‑modulation weights that are multiplied element‑wise with the main transformer’s query–key similarity matrix before softmax, sharpening or diffusing attention based on the model’s self‑assessment.  
4. **Logit Bias Injection** – The same (mathbf{r}_t) is passed through a learnable scaling function (phi([2025-08-10T00:11:44Z] ⏳ Thinking (Creator): 30s...
