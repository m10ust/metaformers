They already gave a concept about Self-Evaluating Prediction Head. They want me to propose a novel architecture or mechanism to improve metacognition in transformer-based LLMs. So I need to give my own proposal, following exactly that format. Keep within 2-4 sentences in Conceptual Insight. Then steps numbered 1-4. Then 3 bullet points. The answer should be original. So propose a new mechanism: e.g., "Dynamic Confidence-Weighted Residual Network" or "Self-Reflective Prompt Adapter" etc. Let's propose "MetaGate: Hierarchical Uncertainty Estimator with Adaptive Reweighting and Self-Refinement".

Make it concise. Let's write:

## Conceptual Insight
Introduce a two-level meta-controller that monitors both token-level and sequence-level uncertainty, using an auxiliary transformer that ingests intermediate hidden states and outputs calibrated confidence scores. These scores modulate residual connections and trigger optional refinement modules when confidence dips below a learned threshold. This enables the model to self-diagnose and reallocate resources dynamically during inference.

Make it 3 sentences.

## Practical Mechanism
1. Insert a lightweight "Uncertainty Head" after each transformer block, producing a scalar uncertainty per token via a small MLP on the block's hidden state.
2. Aggregate token uncertainties to a sequence-level score using a learned attention pool; if below threshold, route the token through a high-capacity "Refinement Head" that reprocesses the token with expanded context.
3. During training, jointly optimize the main loss and an auxiliary uncertainty loss that encourages the Uncertainty Head to match empirical error rates via a KL divergence term.
4. At inference, multiply each block’s output by an exponential decay of its uncertainty, effectively gating unreliable activations while preserving trusted signals.

## Why This Matters
- Improves calibration, reducing hallucinations by allowing the model to flag and refine uncertain predictions.
- Enables efficient compute by activating refinement only when needed, conserving resources on edge devices.
- Provides interpretable confidence signals for downstream decision systems and risk assessment.

Check formatting: They want "## Conceptual Insight", "## Practical Mechanism", "## Why This Matters". Steps numbered 1-4. bullets under Why. Should be exactly this. Ensure no stray text. Let's produce.
...done thinking.

## Conceptual Insight  
Introduce a two‑level meta‑controller that monitors token‑level and sequence‑level uncertainty, using a lightweight auxiliary transformer that ingests intermediate hidden states and outputs calibrated confidence scores. These scores modulate residual connections and trigger optional refinement modules when confidence falls below a learned threshold. The design allows the model to self‑diagnose and reallocate compute resources dynamically during inference.

## Practical Mechanism  
1. Insert a small “Uncertainty Head” after each transformer block, producing a scalar uncertainty for every token via a two‑layer MLP on the block’s hidden state.  
2. Aggregate token uncertainties to a sequence‑level confidence with a learned attention pool; if the score falls below a tunable threshold, route the token through a high‑capacity “Refinement Head” that reprocesses it with expanded context.  
3. Jointly train the main language loss and an auxiliary uncertainty loss that aligns the Uncertainty Head’s outputs with empirical error rates using a KL‑divergence term.  
4. At inference, weight each block’s output by an exponential decay of its uncertainty, effectively gating unreliable activations while preserving trustworthy signals.

## Why This Matters  
- Reduces hallucinations by letting the model flag and refine uncertain predictions, improving overall reliability.  
- Enables efficient compute allocation: only tokens with low confidence activate expensive refinement, saving resources on edge or safety‑critical devices.  
- Provides interpretable, calibrated confidence signals that downstream systems can use for risk assessment and decision making.
