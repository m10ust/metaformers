We need to propose a novel architecture or mechanism to improve metacognition in transformer-based LLMs. We must respond in EXACTLY the given format: "## Conceptual Insight (2–4 sentences)" followed by "## Practical Mechanism" with numbered steps 1-4. Then "## Why This Matters" with bullet points. The content should propose a novel architecture or mechanism to improve metacognition.

We need to follow the instructions exactly: no extra headings, no extra numbering beyond 1-4, no extra bullet formatting beyond what was given. Must maintain the exact structure.

We can propose a mechanism that uses a separate "self-evaluation transformer" that receives intermediate representations and generates a confidence and suggestion for modifications, using an auxiliary loss that encourages consistency. Perhaps using a "meta-attention network" that operates on attention heads, generating a "metacognitive vector" that gates the output.

Alternatively, we can propose a "two-stream transformer" architecture with a "primary" and "metacognitive" branch. The metacognitive branch produces a "reflection vector" that informs gating of the primary outputs and triggers recomputation. Use a "dual-phase" training: first train primary; then fine-tune with meta.

Also we could propose "dynamic attention weighting" via a "self-critic" network that learns to predict the error of the model.

The practical mechanism steps: 1. Add a parallel meta-branch per decoder layer that takes the same input but outputs a scalar per token or vector; 2. Use this meta-output to compute a confidence score; 3. Gate the primary logits accordingly; 4. If low confidence, trigger a re‑run with higher model capacity or different sampling.

The concept: "meta-transformer head that learns to predict the probability of correctness and triggers corrective action".

Why matters: bullet points.

Let's craft accordingly. Need to keep 2-4 sentences for conceptual insight.

Now produce final answer.
...done thinking.

## Conceptual Insight  
We introduce a **Meta‑Transformer Head (MTH)** that runs in parallel with each decoder layer, producing a per‑token confidence vector derived from a lightweight self‑attention mechanism over the layer’s hidden states. This confidence is used to gate the primary logits and, when below a threshold, trigger an adaptive “re‑compute” sub‑module that reallocates attention or depth to that token. By separating the evaluation process from generation, the model can learn to judge its own outputs and adjust computation in a differentiable, data‑driven way.

## Practical Mechanism  
1. **Parallel Meta‑Attention Extraction** – For each decoder layer, a small MTH takes the same hidden representation and applies a depth‑wise attention over the token dimension to output a confidence score (c_t in [0,1]).  
2. **Confidence‑Gated Logit Scaling** – The primary logits (z_t) are multiplied by a gated factor (sigma(lpha (c_t - 	au))), where (sigma) is sigmoid, (lpha) controls sensitivity, and (	au) is a learnable threshold.  
3. **Re‑compute Trigger** – Tokens with (c_t < 	au) are marked for recomputation; a lightweight “re‑compute head” (e.g., a single additional transformer layer with higher capacity) is activated only on these positions, producing refined logits.  
4. **Joint Loss and Calibration** – During training, a secondary loss encourages (c_t) to approximate the true accuracy of the token prediction, while the overall loss back‑propagates through both the primary and meta branches, enabling end‑to‑end learning of metacognitive judgments.

## Why This Matters  
- It reduces hallucinations by allowing the model to self‑detect uncertainty and allocate extra resources where needed.  
- The adaptive computation yields energy and latency savings, especially valuable in safety‑critical or edge deployments.  
- The differentiable confidence signal provides a calibrated uncertainty estimate, improving model interpretability and enabling downstream decision‑making to weigh outputs appropriately.
