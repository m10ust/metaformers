We need to respond in exact format. Provide conceptual insight, practical mechanism steps 1-4, and why this matters with bullet points. The content: propose novel architecture or mechanism to improve metacognition in transformer-based LLMs. We should think of some mechanism like self-reflection modules, meta-attention, external memory for self-evaluation. Provide steps: 1. Self-Score, 2. Meta-attention, 3. Dual-path (primary and meta), 4. Feedback loop. Then why matters: improved error detection, better chain-of-thought, trustworthiness, etc. Ensure we exactly use the format: headings with ##, then exactly 2-4 sentences for conceptual insight, Practical Mechanism with numbered steps 1-4, Why This Matters with bullet points. Ensure no extra lines? Probably can have line breaks. Provide bullet points preceded by dash. No extra headings. Let's produce.
...done thinking.

## Conceptual Insight
A transformer’s hidden states implicitly encode uncertainty, but the model never explicitly evaluates its own predictions. By adding a lightweight meta‑attention head that samples from the internal attention distribution and produces a confidence estimate, we can create a self‑reflective loop that informs the main transformer about when it should reconsider or revise its output. This dual‑signal architecture mirrors human metacognition—“thinking about thinking”—and allows the model to allocate computational resources adaptively.

## Practical Mechanism
1. **Primary Transformer Path** – Standard encoder–decoder layers produce the initial token predictions.  
2. **Meta‑Attention Head** – Parallel to each decoder layer, a small attention module aggregates key‑value pairs to generate a per‑token confidence vector.  
3. **Re‑injection Layer** – The confidence vector modulates the logits of the primary path via gated scaling and can trigger an optional “re‑compute” sub‑module for low‑confidence tokens.  
4. **Learning Signal** – A composite loss combines task loss, confidence calibration loss, and a sparsity penalty on re‑compute activations, encouraging the model to trust its predictions when appropriate.

## Why This Matters
- Enables the model to flag uncertain outputs and optionally request clarification, reducing hallucinations.  
- Provides a differentiable signal for calibration, improving reliability in safety‑critical applications.  
- Allows adaptive computation, saving resources by avoiding unnecessary re‑computation for confident predictions.
