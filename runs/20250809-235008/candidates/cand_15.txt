We need to propose a novel architecture or mechanism to improve metacognition in transformer-based LLMs, in the specified format: Conceptual Insight (2–4 sentences), Practical Mechanism with 4 numbered steps, and Why This Matters bullet list. Must be exactly that format. The answer should propose something new beyond the previous content. Maybe something like "Self‑Calibration Memory (SCM)" that uses a memory module storing past errors and their corrections, etc. Or "Multi‑View Meta-Adapter" that uses separate adapters for confidence and reasoning. But must be novel.

Let's think: We can propose an architecture called "Dynamic Self‑Reinforced Meta‑Attention (DSRMA)" which includes a meta-network that predicts attention shift based on token uncertainty and uses a second-level attention to adjust. Could also incorporate an "Error Prediction Head" that uses a lightweight RNN to detect likely errors and feed back.

Alternatively, propose "Meta‑Contextual Replay Buffer (MCRB)" where the model stores high‑uncertainty token contexts and replays them during training, improving self‑critique.

But must propose mechanism in 4 steps. The steps could be: (1) generate tokens with normal decoder; (2) meta‑module uses uncertainty estimates (via dropout or ensemble) to produce a "confidence map" and "explanatory vector" for each token; (3) feedback loop that adjusts the decoder's next step attention and logits using gating; (4) optional re‑decode of flagged tokens in an inner loop. Similar to earlier but maybe add a memory or reinforcement.

We need to be original. The previous architecture had a Meta‑Critic. Our new one could involve "Self‑Reflexive Layered Memory (SRLM)" that uses an additional memory network that stores previous decoding trajectories and uses them to evaluate current generation. Also incorporate a "Self‑Adversarial Loss" that encourages the meta‑module to produce confident predictions only when appropriate.

Let's propose "Dual‑Perspective Meta‑Attention (DPMA)" with two decoders: generative and meta-critic, but instead of just feeding back confidence, we feed back a "meta‑attention vector" computed by a small transformer that attends over hidden states of the generative decoder and previous outputs, producing a per‑head attention scaling. This modifies the main decoder's attention. Additionally, we incorporate "Confidence‑Guided Weighting (CGW)" of the transformer’s output distribution to produce calibrated logits.

Ok, I'll propose "Self‑Reflective Layered Memory Transformer (SRLM-T)". The idea: maintain a layer of memory that stores token-level embeddings and predicted confidence. The meta-network uses this memory to predict which tokens likely to be wrong, and then uses a gating mechanism to adjust.

Steps: 1. Generate token embeddings. 2. Memory module stores embeddings and meta‑confidence predictions. 3. Meta‑attention uses memory to compute a reflection vector for next step. 4. Gated reweighting of attention and optional inner re‑decode.

Why matters: better error detection, improved calibration, transparency, safer decisions.

But ensure 4 steps. Must be concise. Use bullet points in Why This Matters. Must adhere to format exactly.

Let's produce:

## Conceptual Insight
We propose the Self‑Reflective Layered Memory Transformer (SRLM‑T), a transformer that couples a lightweight meta‑module with an episodic memory of past decoding trajectories. The meta‑module attends over the memory to estimate token‑level confidence, generate a reflection vector, and influence the next-step attention through a gated mechanism. This allows the model to learn when it is likely to err and correct itself without external supervision.

## Practical Mechanism
1. **Parallel Decoder–Meta Module** – Run the standard decoder and a tiny meta‑transformer simultaneously; the meta‑module receives cross‑attention over the decoder’s hidden states and the episodic memory to predict confidence and a short rationale for each pending token.
2. **Reflection Vector Construction** – Aggregate the meta‑confidence scores with the memory’s historical error patterns to form a reflection vector that highlights likely mistakes in the current context.
3. **Gated Attention Re‑calibration** – Use the reflection vector to modulate the main decoder’s multi‑head attention weights via a learned gating network, amplifying confident heads and suppressing uncertain ones for the next decoding step.
4. **Self‑Corrective Inner Loop** – For tokens whose confidence falls below a threshold, inject a corrective bias into the logits and optionally invoke a brief inner‑loop re‑decoding of just that token before finalizing the output.

## Why This Matters
- Provides an internal error‑prediction signal that reduces error propagation in long sequences.
- The episodic memory enables continual learning of failure modes, allowing lifelong calibration of confidence estimates.
- The reflection vector and rationale trace offer transparent, explainable reasoning that aids safety and user trust in high‑stakes applications.
