## Distilled bullets from last 5 Creator outputs

### Block 1
- confidence calibration; measure expected calibration error (ECE) and reduce overconfidence via loss on |ĉ − 1[correct]|
- plan: introduce early-exit policy for “easy” queries; verify compute savings vs. accuracy delta
- retrieval gating with learnable factor g_t; test ablation with/without retrieval under low-confidence
- set thresholds for self-check triggers; verify false-positive/false-negative rates on OOD prompts
- define rubric: 2–4 numbered steps, 3 bullets, and at least one measurable metric per answer

### Block 2
- meta-self-attention over attention maps A_ℓ; rescale attention with token-level confidence c_i
- evaluate: hallucination rate ↓ on factual QA; track calibration and exact-match score
- constraint: ≤3% FLOPs overhead; ablation on residual feedback b_i magnitude (||b||₂)
- test: domain adapters; rank per-domain reward vectors and compare Pareto front vs. single reward

### Block 3
- MetaCritic: multi-objective reward [accuracy, conf-align, coherence, domain]; actor-critic update
- step: maintain rolling buffer (state, action, reward); periodic lightweight policy gradient
- threshold schedule for correction vs. retrieval; measure latency impact (ms) and accuracy delta (%)
- verify with OOD split; track risk of unnecessary re-runs

### Block 4
- practical mechanism: 4–8 steps with numbered sequence; include temperature scheduling tied to c_i
- test: ablation removing confidence head; measure degradation in precision@k and EM
- constraint: LOCAL LLMs ≤20B, low-VRAM quant; prefer knobs that work with Ollama

### Block 5
- evaluate: report compute budget; average passes per query; early-exit savings vs. accuracy
- rubric: Conceptual Insight / Practical Mechanism / Why This Matters present; reject if missing
- verify: log per-token c_i and action logits; audit a few traces for interpretability
