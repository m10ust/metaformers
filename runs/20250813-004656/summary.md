## TL;DR
Local fallback summary used (no/slow summarizer).

## What happened
rst: Conceptual Insight: explain concept of clarifying plan. 2-4 sentences.

Practical Mechanism: 4 steps: Step 1: Collect materials; Step 2: Identify gaps/contradictions; Step 3: Rewrite plan into plain language; Step 4: Circulate for confirmation and schedule call.

But we might also incorporate timeline etc. The instructions: The plan should include those elements. We can produce the 4 steps accordingly.

Why This Matters: 3 bullets: clarity, alignment, accountability.

Make sure the formatting: headings with ##. Each step numbered 1., 2., etc.

Let's do it.
...done thinking.

## Conceptual Insight  
A project’s success hinges on a shared, crystal‑clear roadmap. When a plan is vague, each stakeholder pulls in a different direction, which stalls progress and inflates costs. By transforming the original outline into a plain‑language document that pinpoints objectives, roles, metrics, and timelines, we create a single source of truth that every team member can reference and trust.

## Practical Mechanism  
1. **Collect all existing documentation** – Gather the draft plan, related emails, meeting notes, and any related artifacts that influence the project’s scope.  
2. **Identify gaps, contradictions, and assumptions** – Conduct a quick gap analysis and cross‑check each section against the collected materials to surface inconsistencies or missing details.  
3. **Rewrite the plan in plain language** – Translate the original draft into a concise, readable format, explicitly stating:  
   - Clear objectives and deliverables  
   - Specific roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder  
   - Success metrics (KPIs, deadlines, budget checkpoints)  
   - Dependencies and hand‑off points  
4. **Distribute, confirm, and calibrate** – Circulate the refined plan to all parties for review, collect feedback, and schedule a short alignment call if any ambiguities persist; then lock the final version into a shared repository.

## Why This Matters  
- **Eliminates miscommunication** by ensuring everyone references the same, unambiguous language.  
- **Accelerates decision‑making** with clearly defined roles and success metrics.  
- **Reduces delays and cost overruns** by preventing scope creep and ensuring accountability from the outset.

So first: How does the current output demonstrate that it addresses the original vague plan effectively?
