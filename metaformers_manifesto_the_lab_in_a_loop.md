# Metaformers: The Lab in a Loop  

I don’t need billions in funding, a sterile lab, or a committee in white coats.  
My **Mac Mini is the lab.**  
The **AIs are the funding.**  
And **I am the white coat.**  

Instead of petri dishes, I work with recursive dialogue loops.  
Instead of DNA, I splice prompts.  
Instead of cell division, I watch ideas mutate through iteration.  

Every loop is a micro-evolutionary run in idea space.  
- A **prompt** is the seed.  
- Each **reply** is a mutation.  
- The **feedback pressure of selection** guides which branches survive.  

Like biology, most mutations fail quietly, but a few leap forward — producing new forms, unexpected emergent behavior, and insights that didn’t exist in the starting sequence.  

Metaformers isn’t about building an industrial AI pipeline with over-engineered mutation operators and research grants.  
It’s about proving that *emergence itself* can arise from something as humble as a Python loop and three AIs talking to each other.  

This is **DIY cognitive biology.**  
A desktop experiment in **memetic evolution.**  
A framework where ideas don’t just flow — they replicate, mutate, and evolve.
